desktop-tools
=============
:compact-option:

'desktop-tools' is a collection of tools to run my desktop that might be useful
to other people as well.

 - 'dwmstatus' does literally everything my dwm doesn't but I'd like it to. It
   includes PulseAudio volume management and hand-written NUT and MPD clients,
   all in the name of liberation from GPL-licensed software of course.
 - 'brightness' allows me to change the brightness of w/e display device I have.
 - 'fancontrol-ng' is a clone of fancontrol that can handle errors on resume
   from suspend instead of setting fans to maximum speed and quitting;
   in general it doesn't handle everything the original does

Don't expect them to work under any OS that isn't Linux.
